* Instantiate a map (dict) to store term, count
    * term_count = map(term, int)
* Get the video length, split it into 10 chunks
    * VID_LEN / 10 = CHUNK_LENGTH
    * for (i=0, i < 10, i++) chunks.append(CHUNK_LENGTH * i)
* For each chunk, find a “game time” from regex alone
    * search_interval = int(chunk_length / 10);
    * for (chunk in chunks)
        * set vid_cap to chunk (should be the start time of each chunk)
        * check frame by search_interval
        * if game_time
            * split by whitespace into string array
            * for (term in terms)
                * if (term_count.keyExists(term))
                    * term_count(term) += 1
                * else
                    * term_count(term) = 1
* Print our map to a txt file

* Need to handle halftime
* Better define the bounds to read time
    restrict the box of the image
* Handle command line arguments - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11604653/add-command-line-arguments-with-flags-in-python3
* Read in timestamps from ESPN play-by-play
